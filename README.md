# tibetaneditor

This PyQt5 project is a beta version of readability editor for the Tibetan language.

The readability editor assesses the readability of a text by highlighting words according to their level of difficulty. Levels of frequency are defined by analysing the frequency of words in a given language.

The beta version allows users to:

1. write or paste text in the editor
2. segment and highlight the text by clicking on the segment icon

To test the tool, paste the text from test_source.txt in the editor and click the segmentation icon. The result should look like this:



Features comming soon:

1. level list selection + color picker
2. POS tagging
3. spell-checking
4. rules and vocab list editing for segmentation/POS tagging/spell-checking
5. suggestion of spelling correction
6. suggestion of vocabulary alternative
